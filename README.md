#required applications

This project used GNUplot to plot the data, so you will need to install that
or the graph will not appear.

//TODO: add install instructions

 I'd like to thank maklad for their Pratt parser adapted in Rust. It converted strings into S- expressions and I thought that would make parsing strings and doing math with them easier.

The repo is at https://github.com/matklad/minipratt.


#notes

This projects is in a very early stage, so somethings are prone to not work, and some stuff isnt supported (yet).

Current issues that will be fixed later in development:
Trig functions will not graph
